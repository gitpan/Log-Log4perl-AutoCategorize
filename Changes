Revision history for Perl extension Log::Log4perl::AutoCategorize.

0.02  not yet released
  - Devel::Size now optional
  - switch to Module::Build from MakeMaker
  - changed several package my variables to our (for easier debug)
  - rewrote Pod after re-reviewing Mikes feedback, doing YAPC::NA lightning talk
  - tests:
    all coverage-report tests now use \d+ to match END lines. 
	this is more tolerant of code changes
  - new tests:
	05_initstr.t - overrides default conf w useargs: initstr => $string
	06_conf_file.t - overrides default conf w useargs: initfile => $filename
	07_coexist.t - coexistence with Log::Log4perl
	08_options_more.t - tests -z, which uses Devel::Size
	09_todo_coexist.t - try coexisting with Log::Log4perl ':easy'
	10_packages.t - multiple user packages

0.01   06/09/03 - released to log4perl-devel, PAUSE
  - few more doc refinements
  - total of 4 tests, + 1 cleanup

0.009   06/05/03 - preparatory release
  - based upon Mike Schilli's feedback, reworked the pod.  Ended up
    being a more thorough restructure than I 1st thought it needed.
  - added '# log4perl.category.' as a prefix to usage report; its now 
    editable into a pre-documented log-config file. 
	
0.008  5/30/03 - released to log4perl-devel
  - reworked optimizer sub to munge only invocations like
    Logger->$fn(), where $fn is properly constained, and to properly
    handle nested constructs in the argument-list.
  - refactored logit() out of AUTOLOAD, which is now more focussed on
    creating subroutines for munged-methods.
  - added 1st set of tests.

0.007  Thu May  1 17:56:34 2003
  - original version; created by h2xs 1.21 with options
	-Xm Log::Log4perl::AutoCategorize
	then hacked at a lot 
  - 0.002-5 were pure optimizer experiments, 006 rolled the logging
    application back into the experiment, with 007 yielding basic
    codebase (to 0.01 anyway)

0.001  1/2003

  - posted original wrapper to log4perl-devel using only AUTOLOAD to
    implement the new interface.  Mike Schillis feedback was that
    caller() was too expensive for such extensive use.
  - I muttered something about optimizer, he said, ok..., and I went
    off to see how it could be used to solve the lack of speed.
