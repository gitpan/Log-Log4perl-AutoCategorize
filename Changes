Revision history for Perl extension Log::Log4perl::AutoCategorize.

0.001  1/2003

 - posed original wrapper to log4perl-devel using only AUTOLOAD to
   implement the new interface.  Mike Schillis feedback was that
   caller() was too expensive for such extensive use.

   I muttered something about optimizer, he said, ok..., and I went
   off to see how it could be used to solve the lack of speed.

 - original version; created by h2xs 1.21 with options
	-Xm Log::Log4perl::AutoCategorize
	then hacked at a lot 

 - 0.002-5 were pure optimizer experiments, 006 rolled the logging
   application back into the experiment, with 007 yielding basic
   codebase (to 0.01 anyway).

0.008  5/30/03 - released to log4perl-devel

 - reworked optimizer sub to munge only invocations like
   Logger->$fn(), where $fn is properly constained, and to properly
   handle nested constructs in the argument-list.

 - refactored logit() out of AUTOLOAD, which is now more focussed on
   creating subroutines for munged-methods.

 - added 1st set of tests.

0.009   06/05/03 - preparatory release

 - based upon Mike Schilli's feedback, reworked the pod.  Ended up
   being a more thorough restructure than I 1st thought it needed.

 - added '# log4perl.category.' as a prefix to usage report; its now 
   editable into a pre-documented log-config file. 
	
0.01   06/09/03 - released to log4perl-devel, PAUSE

 - few more doc refinements
