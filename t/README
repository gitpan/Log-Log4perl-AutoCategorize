TESTS HERE


All tests here send Logger output to logfiles, then slurp them in, and
test the contents with a bunch of regular expressions.

Most tests here run a separate script, using a system call, ex:
`perl dflt_stdout.pl > out.basic.stdout 2> out.basic.stderr`

The logfiles all have names like out.$testnum_*, out.$scriptname*,
and/or out.*.cover, as given in the *.t files and in the various
log-config sources (files, strings, or default config).


01_use.t	use it, verifies no syntax errs
02_basic.t	`perl dflt_stdout.pl > out.basic.stdout 2> out.basic.stderr`
		which uses AutoCategorize's default config, and an alias.
		it does calls to aliased Logger, directly from main, 
		from subroutines in main, and from package Foo also in sourcefile

03_options.t	runs dflt_stdout.pl, with cmd-line args to turn on basic debug
04_subclass.t	uses a wrapper, myLogger.pm

05_initstr.t	perl -w tinitstr.pl 2> out.initstr.stderr
		tests override of default config by use-time option

06_conf_file.t	`perl -w tconf_file.pl 2> out.conf_file.stderr
		tests override of default config by use-time option

07_coexist.t	uses both Log::Log4perl::get_logger and myLogger (wrapper from 04)

08_options_more.t	test a bunch more debug options
09_coexist_easy.t	

10_multi_pack.t		
	test usage by a bunch of modules, each in different classes.
	they use different aliases, and different debug options.

99_cleanup.t	deletes all out.* files.
		If you want to inspect them, run the tests individually.
